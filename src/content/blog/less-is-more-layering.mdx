## Less Is More: What Kahneman Teaches Us About Technical Writing

In *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, Daniel Kahneman reveals something every technical writer should know:
**the mind prefers coherence over completeness.**

When we read, we constantly build quick mental models of what’s happening.
If a message is clear, we trust it. If it’s cluttered or contradictory, we tune out—even if it’s accurate.
That’s why *less is more* isn’t just an aesthetic principle. It’s a cognitive truth.

Good documentation works *with* human cognition, not against it.
Minimalism, as refined by researchers like **Hans van der Meij** and **John Carroll**, is how we apply that truth in practice.

## System 1 and System 2: The Two Readers in Every Mind

Kahneman describes two modes of thinking:

* **System 1**: fast, intuitive, automatic
* **System 2**: slow, deliberate, analytical

When readers open documentation, they start in **System 1**.
They’re skimming, looking for quick cues — headings, examples, or one command to copy and run.
If something breaks or feels unclear, **System 2** wakes up to analyze, compare, or debug.

Most users don’t read documentation *linearly*; they **scan, act, and adjust**.
That’s why minimalist writing feels natural: it aligns with how our minds actually process information.

## How System 1 Shapes the Reader’s First Impression

System 1 doesn’t read; it *glances*.
It forms a judgment in seconds:

> “Can I find what I need?”
> “Does this look trustworthy?”

At this stage, your job isn’t to explain — it’s to **make orientation effortless**.

* **Short, task-based titles** signal clarity.
* **Action-first examples** invite success:

  ```bash
  deploy
  ```

  *Deploy your app in one step.*
* **White space and hierarchy** help readers spot structure without thinking.

This satisfies System 1’s craving for coherence — a story that *feels right* before it’s even fully understood.

---

## How System 2 Demands Depth and Precision

Once the reader slows down, System 2 takes over.
This is where **detail, accuracy, and logical order** matter.
Readers start asking: *Why? What happens if I change this?*

This is where **layering** and **progressive disclosure** protect your clarity from oversimplification.

| Layer            | Cognitive Mode | Purpose                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Top layer**    | System 1       | Clear action and core idea              |
| **Middle layer** | Transition     | Context, rationale, structure           |
| **Deep layer**   | System 2       | Full references, exceptions, edge cases |

By structuring docs this way, you honor both readers:

* System 1 gets a quick, coherent path to success.
* System 2 finds the logical depth it needs when curiosity or confusion kicks in.

## Why “Less” Works: Cognitive Economy

Kahneman’s research on *cognitive load* explains why minimalism works so reliably in documentation:

* The mind is **lazy by design** — it conserves energy by simplifying.
* Every extra word or paragraph is a **mental toll**.
* The easier it is to process information, the **more credible** it feels.

That’s why concise documentation builds *trust* faster than exhaustive explanation.
When readers can grasp the core idea instantly, their System 1 rewards them with confidence — and confidence keeps them engaged.

---

## When “Less” Becomes “Not Enough”

Of course, minimalism can go too far.
If the main layer omits essential context, readers hit cognitive dissonance — System 1 says “this feels easy,” but System 2 says “wait, something’s missing.”

Hans van der Meij’s minimalist heuristics prevent that collapse:

1. **Action first** – Give readers something they can do immediately.
2. **Anchor in real tasks** – Use examples drawn from genuine workflows.
3. **Support error recovery** – Anticipate mistakes; show how to fix them fast.
4. **Write for multiple modes of reading** – Skim, study, or locate.

These principles ensure *less* never becomes *less useful*.

## Designing Documentation for Two Minds

Kahneman gives us a lens to test our docs:

| Question                                      | Cognitive Focus | Editing Check                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Can readers grasp the goal instantly?         | System 1        | Simplify, rephrase, front-load |
| Do explanations appear where curiosity peaks? | System 2        | Layer detail, not overload it  |
| Can readers recover easily from mistakes?     | Both            | Inline error support           |
| Does the structure mirror real actions?       | Both            | Task-based organization        |

If a page satisfies both systems, it’s not just readable — it’s *thinkable*.

## The Deeper Lesson: Tell the Right Story

Kahneman’s insight was never about writing — but it might as well have been.
A good story *feels true* because it’s easy to follow.
Good documentation works the same way: it **feels usable** because it’s easy to think through.

Minimalism and layering simply translate that psychology into structure and language.
They ensure that “less is more” never becomes “less is not enough.”

---

## TL;DR for Technical Writers

* **System 1 reads fast:** make your core message visible, actionable, and coherent.
* **System 2 thinks deeply:** provide depth and rationale through layering.
* **Minimalism works** because it matches how humans manage cognitive load.
* The goal isn’t to say less — it’s to make *thinking effortless*.
