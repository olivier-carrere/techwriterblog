In *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, Daniel Kahneman showed that people prefer simple, plausible stories over statistically accurate ones.
In psychological experiments, **a good story often feels more convincing than a good probability**.
This insight captures a powerful idea: *less is more.*

In technical writing, *less is more* takes on a different—but equally vital—meaning.
The minimalist approach emphasizes **clarity, focus, and reduction of cognitive load**.
Readers shouldn’t have to work hard to find the essential information; it should stand out clearly and immediately.

When we combine these two meanings, an interesting lesson emerges for anyone writing concept pages or documentation:

- A clear, focused main message keeps readers from being misled by too much detail.
- Supporting or secondary information should be layered—placed in secondary pages or expandable sections—so that readers can explore only as deeply as they need.

In other words, *less is more* means telling the right story, not the whole story.

## Layering: A Safety Net for Minimalism

In *Layering as a Safety Net for Minimalist Documentation* (1998), **David Farkas** identified a central challenge of minimalist documentation:
**how to be concise without being incomplete**.

The minimalist writer’s goal is to provide just enough information for users to succeed, but some readers will inevitably need more—more context, more reassurance, or more detailed procedures.

Farkas proposed **layering** as the solution. In layered documentation, information is structured into levels that match readers’ needs and curiosity:

- **The top layer** presents the *core information*—the key task, concept, or takeaway that most users seek.
- **Deeper layers** offer optional explanations, examples, and conceptual depth for readers who want to understand more.

This approach transforms minimalism from a risky reduction into a *safe simplification*.
Instead of overwhelming every page with exhaustive detail, writers create **progressive levels of depth**.
Each layer acts as a safety net: if readers don’t understand something at one level, the next layer is ready to catch them.

For example:

- A **concept page** introduces a core idea and its purpose.
- Linked **reference pages** or **expandable sections** describe parameters, exceptions, or underlying principles.
- **Tutorials and examples** form an outer layer, showing how the concept works in practice.

Layering mirrors how people naturally process information online:
they **skim first**, then **dive deeper only when needed**.
It supports both the fast, intuitive thinking Kahneman described (*System 1*) and the slower, analytical reasoning of *System 2*.

## The Balance Between Clarity and Completeness

When applied together, **minimalism and layering** create a balance between clarity and completeness.
Minimalism gives documentation its focus; layering gives it resilience.

By structuring content so that readers can move from **main message → details → depth**, we ensure that
*less is more* never becomes *less is not enough*.

The result is documentation that tells a clear story—one that invites readers to learn just as much as they need, when they need it.
