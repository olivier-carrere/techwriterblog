import ToolsList from '../../components/ToolsList.astro'

If you’ve spent years working daily with the DITA XML platform, you know that DITA is more than a markup language. It’s a way of thinking about information design. Writing tasks, concepts, and references in DITA teaches you to break down content into consistent building blocks, which makes documentation easier to navigate, maintain, and reuse.

The good news is: you don’t need an XML editor or a DITA-OT pipeline to keep practicing those principles. With Markdown and modern docs-as-code workflows, you can implement DITA’s information typing philosophy in a lightweight, flexible way.

## The DITA mindset

DITA trains you to ask:

* **Is this a task?** → A sequence of steps that helps the reader achieve a goal.
* **Is this a concept?** → A piece of explanatory content that builds understanding.
* **Is this a reference?** → A structured lookup table or fact sheet.

Once you’ve internalized this mindset, it becomes natural to apply it even outside XML. Markdown pages, Git-based workflows, and static site generators all benefit when you keep these categories clear.

## DITA-like task pages

DITA task topics have strict rules: short context, prerequisites, ordered steps, results. The official [OASIS example](https://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/step.html) is as follows:

```xml
<task id="sqlj">
<title>Creating an SQLJ file</title>
<taskbody>
<context>Once you have set up SQLJ, you need to create a new SQLJ file.</context>
<steps>
<step>
 <cmd>Select <menucascade><uicontrol>File</uicontrol>
 <uicontrol>New</uicontrol></menucascade>.</cmd>
 <info>New files are created with default values based on a standard template.</info>
</step>
</steps>
</taskbody>
</task>
```

You can recreate this in Markdown easily:

```markdown
# Creating an SQLJ file

Once you have set up SQLJ, you need to create a new SQLJ file.

1. Select **File** > **New**

   New files are created with default values based on a standard template.
```

This keeps the procedural content focused and predictable, just like in DITA.

## DITA-like concept pages

Concepts explain “what” and “why” rather than “how.” The official [OASIS example](https://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/concept.html) is as follows:

```xml
<concept id="concept">
 <title>Introduction to Bird Calling</title>
 <shortdesc>If you wish to attract more birds to your Acme Bird Feeder,
learn the art of bird calling. Bird calling is an efficient way
to alert more birds to the presence of your bird feeder.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
   <p>Bird calling requires learning:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Popular and classical bird songs</li>
    <li>How to whistle like a bird</li>
   </ul>
 </conbody>
</concept>
```

In Markdown, you can still signal that you’re writing a concept by structuring around definition and explanation.

```markdown
# Introduction to Bird Calling

If you wish to attract more birds to your Acme Bird Feeder, learn the art of
bird calling. Bird calling is an efficient way to alert more birds to the
presence of your bird feeder.

Bird calling requires learning:

- Popular and classical bird songs
- How to whistle like a bird
```

The structure shows it’s an explanatory page, not a step-by-step guide.

## DITA-like reference pages

References benefit from structured tables and lists.

Let's consider this edited [OASIS example](https://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/reference.html):

```xml
<reference id="requiredTools">
  <title>Tools required to maintain a big machine</title>
  <refbody>
    <section>
      <title>Small tools</title>
      <ul>
        <li>Hard hat</li>
        <li>Hammer</li>
        <li>Nail</li>
        <li>Metal polish</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Expensive tools</title>
      <ul>
        <li>Drill</li>
        <li>Welding machine</li>
        <li>Torque wrench</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  </refbody>
</reference>
```

Markdown supports tables and lists:

```markdown
## Tools required to maintain a big machine
### Small tools
* Hard hat
* Hammer
* Nail
* Metal polish
### Expensive tools
* Drill
* Welding machine
* Torque wrench
```

This mirrors a DITA reference topic: concise and easy to scan.

## YAML: Ideal for scalable and maintainable reference pages

Switching from Markdown tables to YAML makes your docs site far more scalable and maintainable. YAML’s structured, hierarchical format keeps data organized, easy to update, and ready for dynamic rendering—no more messy tables or broken formatting. It’s readable, comment-friendly, and built for automation, so your content grows with your site, not your headaches.

```yml
tools:
  Small tools:
    - Hard hat
    - Hammer
    - Nail
    - Metal polish
  Expensive tools:
    - Drill
    - Welding machine
    - Torque wrench
```

You can then create the following `src/components/ToolsList.astro` file:

```javascript
---
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import yaml from 'js-yaml';

const yamlPath = path.resolve('./src/data/tools.yaml');
const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(yamlPath, 'utf8');
const data = yaml.load(fileContents);
const tools = data.tools;
---

<h3>Tools required to maintain a big machine</h3>
{Object.entries(tools).map(([category, items]) => (
  <>
    <h4>{category}</h4>
    <ul>
      {items.map(item => (
        <li>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </>
))}
```

Insert the following snippet into your **.mdx** file:

```html
import ToolsList from '../../components/ToolsList.astro'
<ToolsList />
```

Now, your YAML file content automatically renders as follows:

<ToolsList />

## Why this matters

DITA XML can feel heavy to implement in modern docs pipelines. But the discipline you develop with years of daily practice doesn’t vanish when you move to Markdown. Instead, it becomes a superpower.

By bringing DITA’s principles into lightweight environments, you:

* Keep content modular and reusable.
* Reduce ambiguity for readers.
* Simplify onboarding for new writers.
* Make your documentation friendlier to automation and AI-assisted tools.

DITA taught us to think in types, not just topics. Markdown lets us practice that thinking with less overhead, using tools that integrate smoothly into today’s development workflows.

If you’ve worked in DITA for years, don’t see that experience as “outdated.” It’s the foundation for building smarter, cleaner, and more maintainable docs-as-code content today.
