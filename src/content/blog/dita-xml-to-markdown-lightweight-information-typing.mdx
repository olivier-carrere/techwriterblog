title: "From DITA XML to Markdown: lightweight information typing"
snippet: "DITA brought structure through XML, but its complexity often felt heavy. Markdown offers a lightweight alternative where technical writers can still apply DITA’s information typing principles—using open, freely available tools and without the XML overhead."

This blog has a history rooted in **DITA XML**. For years, it explored structured content management—sharing insights, tips, and reflections. Back then, DITA was the gold standard for large-scale technical documentation, but its complexity came at a cost: verbose XML syntax, specialized editors, and intricate publishing pipelines. Initially hosted on **WordPress**, the blog later moved to [**Sphinx**](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) to experiment with alternatives like **reStructuredText**.

Today, the focus has shifted to **Markdown**.

Markdown is a **lightweight markup language**. Unlike XML, it’s human-readable, easy to write, and doesn’t require dedicated software. Yet it still allows technical writers to apply the **DITA philosophy of information typing**, structuring content into **concepts, tasks, and references**.

Instead of relying on heavy XML toolchains, writers can leverage **open, freely available tools**—including static site generators like [**Astro**](https://astro.build/) and its [**Starlight**](https://starlight.astro.build/) theme. Structured documentation is now accessible to a wider audience: individual writers, small teams, open-source contributors, and enterprise documentation teams alike.

This blog is a **work in progress**. Most [legacy content remains in French](https://docs.redaction-technique.org/), but **new content will primarily be in English**. Over time, older posts may be translated or curated to align with this new focus.

The mission remains the same: providing practical insights to help technical communicators navigate the evolving landscape of documentation—now with an emphasis on **lightweight, open, and sustainable practices**.

Stay tuned for posts, tutorials, and experiments at the intersection of **structured writing, lightweight markup, and modern documentation workflows**.
