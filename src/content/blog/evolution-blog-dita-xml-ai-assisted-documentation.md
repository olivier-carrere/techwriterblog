This blog has a history. Years ago, it was created to explore **DITA XML**, sharing insights, tips, and reflections on structured content management, and was hosted on **WordPress**.

As technology and tools evolved, so did the blog. The focus expanded to include **RestructuredText and DITA XML**, and the blog was [developed using Python Sphinx](https://docs.redaction-technique.org/), reflecting the growing interest in documentation frameworks among technical writers and developers alike.

Today, this blog is taking another step forward. The spotlight is now on **Markdown**, especially in the context of **Astro** and **Starlight**, which are shaping the future of documentation-oriented websites.

Alongside this, the blog will explore how **technical writers can leverage AI** to enhance content creation, streamline workflows, and improve documentation quality.

This blog is a **work in progress**. While many older posts are still in French, **most new content will be published in English**, and over time, older posts will either be translated or pruned.

The goal remains the same: to provide insights and practical knowledge to help technical communicators navigate the evolving landscape of documentation tools and practices.

Stay tuned for new posts, tutorials, and explorations at the intersection of **writing, technology, and AI**.
