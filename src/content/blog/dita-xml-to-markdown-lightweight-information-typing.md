title: "From DITA XML to Markdown: lightweight information typing"
snippet: "DITA brought structure through XML, but its complexity often felt heavy. Markdown offers a lightweight alternative where technical writers can still apply DITA’s information typing principles—using open, freely available tools and without the XML overhead."

This blog has a history. It began years ago with a strong focus on **DITA XML**—sharing insights, tips, and reflections on structured content management. At that time, DITA represented the gold standard for large-scale technical documentation, but it came with a price: the weight of XML syntax, specialized editors, and complex publishing pipelines. The blog itself was first hosted on **WordPress**, then migrated to [**Sphinx**](https://docs.redaction-technique.org/) to explore alternatives like **reStructuredText**.

Today, the spotlight has shifted. The new focus is on **Markdown**.  

Markdown is a **lightweight markup language**. Unlike XML, it is easy to read and write, requires no dedicated software, and integrates seamlessly with modern publishing workflows. Yet, it still provides enough structure for technical writers to apply the **DITA philosophy of information typing**—organizing content into concepts, tasks, and references.  

Instead of heavy XML toolchains, writers can now rely on **freely available tools** such as static site generators (**Astro**, **Starlight**) and open ecosystems. This makes structured documentation more accessible—not just to enterprise teams, but also to individual writers, open-source contributors, and small organizations.

This blog is a **work in progress**. Many older posts are still in French, but **most new content will be in English**. Over time, older material will either be translated or pruned.

The goal remains unchanged: to provide insights and practical knowledge that help technical communicators navigate the evolving landscape of documentation—this time with a stronger emphasis on **lightweight, open, and sustainable practices**.

Stay tuned for new posts, tutorials, and explorations at the intersection of **structured writing, lightweight markup, and modern documentation workflows**.
