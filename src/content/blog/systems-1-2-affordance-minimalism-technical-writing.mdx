## Food for Thought: Systems 1 and 2, Affordability, and Minimalism

Arguably, tech writers’ role is to relieve users from cognitive load.
In a world flooded with information, users don’t need more data — they need clarity. Every sentence in a help article, API guide, or UI tooltip is a chance to reduce friction, simplify decisions, and help people think less about how to do something and more about what they want to achieve. Great technical writing isn’t about showcasing expertise; it’s about designing understanding.


In *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, Daniel Kahneman distinguishes between two modes of human cognition:

* **System 1**, which is fast, intuitive, and automatic.
* **System 2**, which is slow, deliberate, and analytical.

This framework has profound implications not only for psychology but also for **technical communication** and **user experience (UX)**.

### Writing for System 1

When we write technical documentation, especially instructional content, we often assume readers are engaging their System 2 — carefully reading, analyzing, following logic. But in practice, most users read docs when they’re *in the middle of a task*, under time pressure, with cognitive load already high. That’s when System 1 dominates.

**So what would it mean for technical writing to target System 1?**

It would mean leaning into **heuristics** — cues that help readers act quickly without overthinking. Clear visual hierarchy, strong verbs, scannable structure, and obvious affordances (“click,” “type,” “drag”) allow the reader’s intuitive mind to guide action. This is writing that *shows*, not explains; *triggers recognition*, not recall.

### Minimalism and the Reduction of Cognitive Load

This is where **minimalism**, as developed by John Carroll and Hans van der Meij, intersects beautifully. Their minimalist principles emphasize:

* Focusing on *real tasks*, not exhaustive coverage.
* Providing *quick access* to needed information.
* *Eliminating unnecessary explanation* or conceptual overhead.

Minimalism is a practical strategy for engaging System 1 — it minimizes the cognitive friction that forces readers into slow, effortful System 2 processing. The minimalist writer designs for fast comprehension and immediate action.

### DITA and Systems Thinking

Within a DITA framework, the distinctions among **tasks**, **concepts**, and **references** map intriguingly to Kahneman’s systems:

* **Tasks**: System 1 — quick, procedural, heuristic. “Do this, then that.”
* **References**: System 2 — detailed, precise, analytical. “Here’s what each parameter means.”
* **Concepts**: Bridging both systems — they explain *why*, offering meaning without overburdening the user with detail.

A well-structured DITA content set therefore offers an *affordance of cognitive control*: readers can choose whether to stay in System 1 or engage System 2, depending on their momentary goal.

### Affordance: Making Action Obvious

In UX, **affordance** describes the qualities of an interface that suggest how it should be used — a button that *looks* clickable, a slider that *invites* dragging.

In writing, *affordance* can be seen in the linguistic and structural signals that invite certain actions or interpretations. A heading like “To create a new project” affords a clear next step; an inline code sample affords copying and adapting. The text “feels” usable — not just understandable.

### Bringing It All Together

Minimalism reduces friction. Affordance guides action. System 1 thrives on clarity and cues; System 2 builds understanding and mastery.
When technical communication balances these systems — intuitive guidance supported by analytical depth — it becomes not just informative, but humane.

Good documentation doesn’t just tell users what to do. It *thinks with them* — fast or slow.
